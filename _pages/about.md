<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a young researcher at Fudan University. I completed my Ph.D. at Peking University. After that, I pursued postdoctoral research at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am a youth editorial board member for the Journal of Systems Science and Complexity. 

My research interest includes dynamic online algorithms for complex data (functional data, matrix data, high-dimensional data, etc.) and policy evaluation for spatio-temporal data with interferience. I am also interested in incorporating machine learning methods and theory, ordinary/partial differential equations with statistical modeling and inference.

- **Yang Y.** and Yao F.* (2022). [Online estimation for functional data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.2002158). *JASA*.
  + In this work, we propose a dynamic candidate bandwidth method and apply it to functional data analysis for the mean and covariance estimation in the online context.

- **Yang Y.**, Yao F.* and Zhao P. (2023). [Online smooth backfitting for generalized additive model](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2023.2182213). *JASA*.
  + We propose an online smoothing backfitting method for generalized additive models coupled with local linear estimation. The idea can be extended to general nonlinear optimization problems.

- Chen Z.#, **Yang Y.**# and Yao F.* (2023). [Dynamic matrix recovery](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2023.2297468). *JASA*. 
  + In this article, we propose a general framework for dynamic matrix recovery of low-rank matrices that evolve smoothly over time.

- Luo S.#, **Yang Y.**#, Shi C.#, Yao F., Ye J. and Zhu H*. (2024). [Policy evaluation for temporal and/or spatial dependent experiments](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article-abstract/86/3/623/7511800?redirectedFrom=fulltext). *JRSSB*.
  + The aim of this article is to establish a causal link between the policies implemented by technology companies and the outcomes they yield within intricate temporal and/or spatial dependent experiments.

- **Yang Y.**, Shi C., Yao F., Wang S. and Zhu H.* (2024+). [Spatially randomized designs can enhance policy evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11400).
  + This article studies the benefits of using spatially randomized experimental designs which partition the experimental area into distinct, non-overlapping units with treatments assigned randomly. 

- Zhang W.#, **Yang Y.**# and Yao F. (2024+). [Spatial interference detection in treatment effect model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04836). 
  + We introduce a low-rank and sparse treatment effect model that leverages data-driven techniques to identify the locations of interference effects, which allows for interference with heterogeneous forms.
